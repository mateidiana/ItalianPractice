This repository contains a simple computer network app for practicing Italian grammar, using socket programming in Java and Python and the TCP and UDP protocols. First, run one server (either TCP or UDP), then run client 1 and client 2 that use the same protocol in order to connect to the server. The clients will now alternatively get a multipe choice question and have to complete a sentence in Italian. The two players have 6 exercises to complete and 3 mistakes are allowed total. They each receive a feedback after each exercise. A message is shown when the clients have won/lost the game.
